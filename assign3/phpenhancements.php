    <h2>Sorting list's order</h2>
    <p>
      In this website I have made a page named Manage2. In this page the manager can sort the order of the EOI list if he wants. I have made
      a drop down box where all the EOIs are listed. By selecting an EOI from the drop down list the manager can sort the 
      order of the EOI list in which the EOI records are displayed.
    </p>

    <h2>Storing Job details</h2>
    <p>
      I have an another page named Job2. The company can store the details of the job in database in that page. Also they can 
      edit and update the job details that are already stored in the database. Thus they can restore the updated details of the job in the database. 
      By clicking the 'Delete' button they can delete any job details from the table.
